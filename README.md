# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery in software project management is crucial to meeting client expectations, maintaining budget constraints, and staying competitive. Delays can lead to increased costs, lost opportunities, and dissatisfied stakeholders.Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by:
Effective Planning – Setting clear goals, timelines, and milestones.
Agile Methodologies – Using iterative development and continuous feedback.
Resource Management – Allocating tasks efficiently and preventing bottlenecks.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures a software project stays within budget, maximizing profitability and resource efficiency while preventing financial risks. Poor cost management can lead to delays, reduced quality, or project failure. Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns:
Accurate Budget Planning – Define realistic cost estimates based on project scope.
Scope Management – Avoid scope creep by setting clear requirements and change control processes.
Resource Optimization – Allocate manpower and tools efficiently to prevent overspending.
Continuous Monitoring – Track expenses using project management and financial tools.
Risk Management – Identify potential financial risks early and prepare contingency plans.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
*Agile Methodology advantages:
-Iterative, flexible, and adaptable to change.
-Encourages continuous feedback and collaboration.
-Delivers working software in shorter cycles (sprints).
*Agile Methology disadvantages:
-Requires strong team communication and discipline.
-Harder to predict final costs and timelines.
-Less structured documentation.

*Waterfall Methodology advantages:
-Well-defined phases with clear documentation.
-Easier to estimate costs and schedules.
-Works well for projects with stable requirements.
*Waterfall Methodology disadvantages:
-Inflexible; difficult to accommodate changes.
-Late-stage issues are costly to fix.
-Delivers the final product only at the end.
